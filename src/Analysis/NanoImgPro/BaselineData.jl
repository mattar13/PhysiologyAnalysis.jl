# 1. Baseline Correction
#############################

"""
    baseline_als(y; lam=1e7, p=0.25, niter=20)

Asymmetric Least Squares baseline correction.
# Parameters
- `y::Vector{T}`: The input signal to be corrected, where `T` is a subtype of `Real`.
- `lam::T=1e7`: The smoothing parameter (λ) that controls the smoothness of the baseline. A higher value enforces a smoother baseline by penalizing large differences between consecutive points. Typical values range from 10⁴ to 10⁹. Adjust `lam` based on the desired smoothness; larger values yield smoother baselines.
- `p::T=0.25`: The asymmetry parameter that determines the weighting between positive and negative residuals. It should be in the range (0, 1). For signals with positive peaks, `p` is usually set between 0.001 and 0.1. A smaller `p` reduces the influence of positive deviations, making the baseline less sensitive to peaks.
- `niter::Int=20`: The number of iterations for the algorithm to perform. Each iteration refines the baseline estimate. Typically, `niter` is set between 10 and 20. More iterations can lead to a more accurate baseline but will increase computation time.

If the peaks are very sudden, p gives you the best chance of fixing it
Uses a second–difference regularization (similar to Eilers & Boelens, 2005).

filter is applied in a centered manner. (For best centering, use an odd window size.)
